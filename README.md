**Image Generation to Aid Diagnosis in Healthcare**

There are two portions to this project: Classification and Generation.

The overall idea is to create a system where medical experts can use an image generation model to generate an image of a disease.
This image can help them relate scans and images of patients to photos of real and niche diseases.
This can help doctors be more precise and make better conclusions about cancer and additional diseases.

In order to ensure that the generation model is providing qualified images, a top notch classification model will classify the image generated by the generation model.
If the classification model is able to correctly classify the image as the text that was given to the generation model in the start, the generated image is accurate.

The dataset we are using for this project is PathMNIST from the bigger dataset MedMNIST.

So far, our results for the classification portion can be found here:
